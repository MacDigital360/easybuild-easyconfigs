description = """An extensive set of data (pre-)processing and analysis methods and tools for metabolomics and other
 omics, with a strong emphasis on statistics and machine learning. This toolbox allows the user to build extensive
 and standardised workflows for data analysis. The methods and tools have been implemented using class-based templates
 provided by the struct (Statistics in R Using Class-based Templates) package. The toolbox includes pre-processing
 methods (e.g. signal drift and batch correction, normalisation, missing value imputation and scaling), univariate
 (e.g. ttest, various forms of ANOVA, Kruskalâ€“Wallis test and more) and multivariate statistical methods (e.g. PCA
 and PLS, including cross-validation and permutation testing) as well as machine learning methods (e.g. Support
 Vector Machines). The STATistics Ontology (STATO) has been integrated and implemented to provide standardised
 definitions for the different methods, inputs and outputs."""
